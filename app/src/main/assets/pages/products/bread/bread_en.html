    <p> <b> Definition by appearance. </b> Bread should not be crushed or cracked. It cannot be black or green. It should have “its own unique aroma”, and not the smell of mold. </p>
     <p> If the bread contains an expired product, then when it is compressed, a slight smell of mold is felt. If you press on the bread, and it is not restored back, then this loaf is not baked. </p>
     <p> When choosing a baguette, if they knock, the sound should be empty. In this case, it is normal for use. </p>
