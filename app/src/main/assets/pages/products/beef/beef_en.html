   <p> <b> Freshness of meat </b> is determined by:
        <ul>
            <li> condition and color of fat </li>
            <li> smell </li>
            <li> consistency, structure </li>
            <li> the quality of the broth obtained by cooking meat </li>
            <li> tendon condition </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b> Determination of the state and color of fat. </b> The pulp should have a color from bright pink (chicken) to dark brown (beef). Any stains, gray patches are unacceptable. If a piece has bones, their color should be white, as well as joints.
        Fat layers can be yellow or almost white.
        <br/> In the “fresh state” beef fat is white, yellowish or yellow; the consistency is solid, crumbles when crushed; pork - white or pale pink, soft, elastic; lamb - white, the texture is dense. Fat is not
        must have a smell of salting or rancidity. In carcasses or meat of dubious freshness, greyish-greasy fat sticks slightly to the fingers and may have a slight smell of salting. In stale condition greyish-matte fat, when crushed
        smeared. Pork fat is covered in a small amount of mold. The smell is rancid.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b> Determination by smell. </b> First, the smell of the surface layer of the test samples is determined, and then from the surface of a fresh cut of meat. When examining the carcass or its parts, special attention is paid to the smell of layers of muscle tissue adjacent to the bone.
        “Fresh meat” - has a specific smell characteristic of each type of fresh meat. In meat of “doubtful freshness” it is slightly sour or with a tinge of mustiness, while in “stale” meat it is sour, musty or slightly putrid.

    <p>
        <b> Determination by structure. </b> Press the finger on the surface of the meat, and then observe the rate of disappearance (replenishment) of the resulting fossa. “Fresh meat” - dense, elastic in the section; fossa formed by finger pressure
        aligns. With "doubtful freshness" in the cut, the meat is less dense and less elastic; the fossa formed by pressure is leveled out slowly (within 1 min), the fat is soft, and it is slightly loosened in thawed meat. "Stale meat" in the cut
        flabby; the fossa formed by pressing with a finger does not equalize, the fat is soft, it is friable in thawed meat.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b> Determination by the quality of the broth. </b> In "fresh" meat, the broth is transparent and fragrant. With “doubtful freshness” of meat, it is transparent or cloudy with a smell not characteristic of fresh broth; meat in “stale state” has a muddy broth with a large
        amount of flakes, with a sharp unpleasant odor.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b> Determination of the state of tendons. </b> On the carcass or in parts of it, in the joints, their elasticity and density, as well as articular surfaces, are evaluated. Fresh meat tendons are elastic, dense, the surface of the joints is smooth, shiny. Thawed
        the tendon meat is soft, friable, bright red. In the stage of “doubtful freshness” the tendons are less dense, dull white. The articular surfaces are slightly covered with mucus. In the "stale" state, the tendons are softened, grayish in color, and the articular
        surfaces are covered with mucus.
